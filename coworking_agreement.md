# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*

Both team members need reliable internet access, a laptop, and access to the project repository and shared tools (GitHub, Slack)

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

We will work primarily together during live-sharing coworking sessions, writing code collaboratively in real time. We will use GitHub for version control and shared tools for live collaboration.

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*

We learn best by coding together, talking through problems out loud, and seeing solutions implemented in real time.

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*

We prefer immediate, kind, and constructive feedback during live sessions, with clear explanations.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*

We want to improve explaining our thought process clearly while coding together.

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
